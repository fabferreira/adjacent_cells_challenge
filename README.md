# adjacent_cells_challenge

See https://minderacraft.workable.com/j/85F6E6EF6F for the complete list of Mindera Graduate Program challenges.
This simple python program is used to solve the adjacent cells challenge (https://tinyurl.com/mindera-graduates-grid)

Just change the name of the input json file (line 43), preset to "100x100.json", to your file name.
You can also input your file name each time you run the program by replacing line 43 with:
 
input_file = input("Please input json file name: ")
